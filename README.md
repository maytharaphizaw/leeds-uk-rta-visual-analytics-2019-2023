# Visualisation of Road Traffic Accidents in Leeds (2019–2023)

This repository contains the code, data outputs, and dashboards developed for my MSc Data Science dissertation at Leeds Beckett University.  
The project integrates **STATS19 collision data**, **Open-Meteo weather data**, and **Leeds United football fixtures** to analyse road traffic accident risks in Leeds.

---

## 🚦 Project Goals
- Study how **events** (football matches), **weather**, **time patterns**, **demographics**, and **infrastructure** affect accident risk.  
- Build **interactive Tableau dashboards** to make the findings accessible for policymakers.  
- Use **Python** for preprocessing, cleaning, and SARIMA time-series forecasting.
