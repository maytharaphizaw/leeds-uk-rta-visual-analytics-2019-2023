## Overview

Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) are a major public health issue. This project integrates **STATS19** collision data with **weather** (rainfall & sunshine) and **Leeds United matchdays** to study:
- Event-related risk (±3 hours around kick-off, **7 km** radius of Elland Road),
- Weather effects (light rain & glare),
- Temporal patterns (rush hours, Fridays, COVID dips),
- Demographics (male drivers, 11–15 pedestrians, cyclists),
- Infrastructure (single carriageways, uncontrolled junctions).

Outputs are delivered via **interactive Tableau dashboards** to support evidence-based road safety decisions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, geopy, folium, tqdm, matplotlib)
- **Tableau** (interactive dashboards, calculated fields)
- **Git LFS** (for `.twbx`, `.pptx`, large CSVs)
- **Conda** environment
